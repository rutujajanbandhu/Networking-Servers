# Single Process (Server)
To implement the single-process server-client network

- We'll need the IP address of the host, in order to successfully set a network between server and client.

To get the IP address of the host. Run -

```bash
  ip address show
```

Enter the host IP address and the post number.
```bash
  Enter Host IP Address: 172.31.27.135 
```
```bash
  Enter the Port Number: 5000
```
### Start the Server

```bash
  python server.py
```
The server will start listening for client connections.

### Start the Client

```bash
  python client.py
```
The client will prompt you to enter the math operation details (e.g., add/subtract/multiply/divide, operands).
