# Networking-Servers-
NetConnect is a revolutionary networking project that combines single-server client communication with multi-server scalability. This seamless integration optimizes performance, enhances security, and simplifies network management. It empowers organizations with a flexible and reliable network solution for a connected future.

PART I - Single Process (Server)
- In the single-processor server-client connection, the server can only handle one client at a time.
- When a client connects to the server, the server accepts the connection and initiates a new thread to handle the client's request.
- While the server is serving the first client, it cannot accept new connections from other clients.
- If a second client attempts to connect while the first client is still being served, the connection request will be denied, and the second client will receive an error message.
- The server program processes client requests sequentially, one at a time.
- If a second client attempts to connect before the server is ready to accept new connections, it will receive an error message indicating that the server is busy, and the client should try again later.
